********* Observations About Wes' Base Style Sheet ********

I noticed that Wes uses a css declaration in the top of his style.css file to normalize the browser styles, so I found a version of it online and a python script that would minify css files and I've gone ahead and added that css file BEFORE the base style.css in the index.html file. Also, Wes makes all the elements on the page use a box-sizing: border-box, which means that the width/height and min/max properties will be based on the contents, padding, and border of boxes, not just the contents.

******** Intro To Flexbox *********

Flexbox is a different way of thinking about layouts, a different mental model, so we need to approach it as such and try not to think about other layout concepts like floats when approaching flexbox.

To utilize the flexbox properties, you will need a parent container, which will be the flex-container. You simply set the display type of the parent container to flex (or inline-flex, covered later), and then all of the items in that container become flex-items.

********* Working With Flex Direction ****************

The flex-direction property sets the main axis to be either left-to-right (row) or top-to-bottom (column). This is really important to understand, as it impacts the way most of the other properties will behave. If you set the flex-direction to row on the flex-container, then the flex-items will take up the entire height of the flex-container and will stack horizontally left-to-right on the page. If you set the flex-direction to column, then the flex-items will take up the entire width of the container, and will stack vertically top-to-bottom. There are two axis' when dealing with a flex-container, the main axis and the cross axis. When the flex-direction is row, the main axis runs left-to-right, horizontally, and the cross axis runs top-to-bottom, vertically. When the flex-direction is set to column, the main axis runs top-to-bottom, vertically, and the cross axis runs left-to-right, horizontally. If you don't set a flex-direction property, it is automatically set to row. There are row-reverse and column-reverse properties as well. In row-reverse, the main axis is still horizontal, but the items are laid out right-to-left. In column-reverse, the main axis is still vertical, but the items are laid out bottom-to-top.
